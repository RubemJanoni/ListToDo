# List To Do

List To Do is a tool that offers the user to print a list of tasks, in a quick and practical way.

## Features
- Navigation

Navigation is simple and intuitive, with an area for displaying the list, an input for receiving data and two buttons, Reset and Print, to reset the screen and print, respectively.

## The Header


The header only consists of a logo on the left and the title on the right.

## The Section

The main section initially presents a standard task list, which is replaced by data entered by the user, through element manipulation.

## Data manipulation

Data manipulation takes place through the input, which receives data from the user and after pressing the "Enter" key, sends the data to the section above. The "Reset" and "Print" buttons complement the functionality.
