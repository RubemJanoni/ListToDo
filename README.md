## The Gallery Section

The Gallery section presents two basic poses of Yoga, through two images, between the images a mini class was introduced, "Yoga poses for Beginners", presenting the main movements of Yoga. The video was embedded from Youtube, saving your storage space.

The footer section includes links to the relevant social media sites for Life Yoga Club, changing color on hover.

The links will open to a new tab to allow easy navigation for the user.

The footer is valuable to the user as it encourages them to keep connected via social media
